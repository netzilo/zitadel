title: Technical Advisory 10011

## Date and Version

Version: 2.59.0

Date: 2024-08-19

## Description

Version 2.59.0 allows more combinations in the identity provider options. As of now, **automatic creation** and **automatic linking options** were only considered if the corresponding **allowed option** (account creation / linking allowed) was enabled.

Starting with this release, this is no longer needed and allows administrators to address cases, where only an **automatic creation** is allowed, but users themselves should not be allowed to **manually** create new accounts using an identity provider or edit the information during the process.
Also, allowing users to only link to the proposed existing account is now possible with an enabled **automatic linking option**, while disabling **account linking allowed**. 

## Statement

This change was tracked in the following PR:
[feat(idp): provide auto only options](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/8420), which was released in Version [2.59.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.59.0)

## Mitigation

If you previously enabled one of the **automatic** options with the corresponding **allowed** option, be sure that this is the intended behavior.

## Impact

Once this update has been released and deployed, the **automatic** options can be activated with the corresponding **allowed** option.
